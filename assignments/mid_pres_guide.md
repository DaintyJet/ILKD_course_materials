**KDLP Fall 2023 Midterm Presentation Guidelines**

* Overview:
    * Short presentation about research into a topic of your choice live during class
    * Propose topic and outline ahead of time
    * Plenty of room to be creative ðŸ™‚
* Example midpoint presentation topics (pick one of these or propose your own):
    * What is the OOM killer?
    * Why are there multiple versions of some syscalls with numbers at the end (e.g. `accept`, `dup`, `pipe`, etc)? What do the numbers refer to? What issue were they added to address?
    * Why do some syscalls have a version ending in `at` (e.g. `open`, `fstat`, `rename`, `symlink`, etc)? What issue were they added to address?
    * What does `.config` do? How does it interact with the build process for the kernel?
    * What is physical and virtual memory? Why is there a distinction between the two?
    * What is the history of git? How does it fit into the bigger picture of version control software?
    * How do container technologies like Podman, Docker, or LXC "share" a kernel with the host machine? What do they not share? What mechanisms of the linux kernel underly this technology?
    * How does the linux BPF system let userspace run arbitrary code in kernel mode? What techniques does it use to ensure that this is safe?
    * What concept does the phrase "Don't break userspace" refer to in the linux kernel? What does it look like in practice?
    * What is the linux VDSO? What problem does it try to solve? How does it compare to other historical techniques like vsyscall?
    * Or suggest your own!
