### E2 - Your first kernel module üçø

You will specify, implement, and test
a simple kernel module that creates a `kdlp` entry
in the Linux kernel's
[`/proc`](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html)
filesystem with a basic read only interface
that returns a unchanging message which includes the student's name.

#### Outcomes:

* Get familiar with the internals of Linux's
[`/proc`](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html) filesystem

* Learn how to specify the behavior of a kernel module
with a guided example

* Get familiar with software testing,
how to write good tests, and how to develop code using tests as a guide

* Write your first kernel module!

#### What to submit:

* A first patch adds a directory `username/E2` to the assignment repo with a filled out copy of the `specification.txt` file.

* A second patch which adds your testing program and makefile to `username/E2`

* A patch which adds your kernel module source to `username/E2` and modifies the makefile to add support for compiling it

* Don't forget your cover letter (as always).

* Submit your patches to exercise2@COURSE_DOMAIN

#### Procedure:

0. Create your `username/E2` directory

    0. Copy `E2.txt` from the repository root as `username/E2/specification.txt`

0. Edit your copy of `specification.txt` and fill in the blanks
to fully specify the expected behavior of your module.

0. At this point you can `git add` the specification file and make your first commit

0. Write a testing program and makefile
that exercises all the functionality your module will have
according to the specification
by performing operations on the file
that it will create in `/proc`

    * Be sure to write tests for all the behavior
    (existence of the file, file permissions,
    behavior of reading, writing, seeking, etc.)

    * Make sure to also test error conditions
    to make sure strange user input to your module
    won't crash the system, e.g. a null or invalid pointer

    * You should have at least 10 distinct tests
    that the module can pass or fail

        * When run, the program should provide information
        about which tests succeeded or failed

        * If a test failed, include in the program output
        how the behavior differed from what was expected

    * At this point, you have nothing to test

        * In order to validate your testing program,
        temporarily change the hard-coded path of the file it opens

        * Instead of opening a file in `/proc`,
        you can have it open a regular file
        whose contents/owner/permissions
        you can change manually
        to see which tests pass or fail

        * Don't forget to change this back before committing your code
        (or write your program / makefile
        in such a way that
        what file is used can be overridden
        from the default in `/proc` for testing)

0. At this point you can `git add`
your makefile and testing program
and make your second commit

0. Implement the module

    * Update your makefile so it can build/clean,
    load/unload, and test your kernel module

    * The kernel code in
[`fs/proc/cmdline.c`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5/source/fs/proc/cmdline.c)
    and
[`kernel/configs.c`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5/source/kernel/configs.c)
    contain examples that create simple `/proc` entries
    that providing access read-only data

    * Use the newer, better `proc_create_single` API
    from the `/proc/cmdline` code

    * However, reference the code for `/proc/config.gz`
    for information on how to remove a `/proc` entry

    * Hint: You can do this with three functions:
    init, exit, and one that generates the data

    * Don't overcomplicate things

0. Submit your patches to `exercise2@COURSE_DOMAIN` by the due date.
