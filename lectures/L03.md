1. Important note about disk resizing is available in the matrix server

1. Today we will continue to build our minimal Linux distribution we began last class

1. Correction: though the QEMU option is `-initrd`, we are in fact using an `initramfs`

1. We will add busybox, which is a single binary containing many common Linux utilities

    1. First, we need to compile busybox as a static binary since we won't have a dynamic linker nor C library in our VM

    1. We can disable applet links and simply include the busybox binary to see how busybox works

    1. We can include the links to add back in all the familiar utilities

    1. However, we can't compile any new programs

1. At the end of the day, have a simple working userspace, but it can't do very much
